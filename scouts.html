<p>Scouts is for young people aged 10.5 - 14 who want to go on lifechanging adventures! We meet on a Thursday night 19:30 - 21:00 and have lots
of weekend events too. We go on at least four camps a year and take part in lots of different competitions. We do some activities like sleeping
in a shelter we built, go on hammock camps and even build catapults using pioneering poles.</p>
