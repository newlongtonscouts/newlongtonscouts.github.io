<p>Stanhope ESU (named after the Indiana Jones of the Victorian times - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Hester_Stanhope">Hester Stanhope</a>) meet in New Longton on a Wednesday evening. We offer fun,
challenge adventure for 14-18 year olds. We offer a quality programme, which delivers all levels of the Duke of Edinburgh Award and gives our young
people the opportunities needed to earn their King's Scout Award by the time they're 18.</p>
