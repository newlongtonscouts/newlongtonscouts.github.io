<p>Stanhope ESU (named after the Indiana Jones of the Victorian times - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Hester_Stanhope">Hester Stanhope</a>) meet in New Longton on a Wednesday evening. We offer fun,
challenge adventure for 14-18 year olds. We offer a quality programme, which delivers all levels of the Duke of Edinburgh Award and gives all young
people all the opportunities needed to earn their Queen Scout Award by the time they're 18.</p>
