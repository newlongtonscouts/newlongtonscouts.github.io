<h3>What is the youngest age my child can begin?</h3>
Five and three quarters.

<h3>I am not sure if my child will like Scouting, can they come and try it?</h3>
We hope they will like it, but they are welcome to come and give it ago. To get in touch, visit the Join the Adventure page.
<br>
<h3>How much does it cost to be in Scouting?</h3>
It costs 10 pounds a month (most parents pay over standing order) and this covers all of evening activities unless the young people have asked us to do
something particuarly expensive as part of their programme e.g. gliding. Residential activities cost extra, but are very reasonably priced for what the young people
recieve.

<h3>Where can I get uniform from?</h3>
Some parents buy them from the Delta Woolshop in New Longton; others buy them online from the Scout Shop.
<br>
<h3>Do you need adult volunteers?</h3>
Yes! We are in constant need of adults to support us in giving young people lifechanging adventures. Whether you can give up 90 minutes a week to help
support one of sections; support us with organising and maintaining equiptment or would like to help us on camps we'd love to hear from you.
