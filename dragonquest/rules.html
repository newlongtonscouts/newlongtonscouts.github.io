<br><br>
These are guidelines, and may vary at some checkpoints but they will be the same for all teams.
<br><br>
Deductions of points will be made for teams significantly off the route or observed not following the Country Code.
<br><br>
All teams <i>must</i> carry a mobile phone for emergency use, with the contact number registered at the start. Mobile phones must only be used in an emergency and then <b>to contact the event emergency numbers who will contact parents if necessary</b>.
<br><br>
The use of GPS devices or digital maps are not allowed. Information from tracking devices will not be used to adjust scores.
<br><br>
The use of mobile phones during the competition (other than to request help) is not allowed. Any participant seen using a phone during the event may have points deducted from their team score.
<br><br>
No member of a team may leave the event without the permission of the event leaders. Scouts retiring from the event will be taken to the finish where they can be collected by parents at the end of the event.
<br><br>
Neckerchiefs are to be worn by all competitors (and ideally leaders and Young Leaders too).
<br><br>
Time Recording Cards must not be altered by competitors; lost cards will lead to lost points.
<br><br>
All teams must be properly equipped (see Kit List page) or will not be allowed to start, in particular, all competitors <b>must</b> wear walking boots which provide ankle support and must have a waterproof coat and overtrousers.
<br><br>
Sufficient food and drink must be carried for the day's walk, plus emergency rations. Emergency rations are to be sealed in a clear plastic bag.
