<span style = "font-size: 50px; text-align: center; display: block;"><b>1st New Longton's walking event is back for 2024!</b></span>
<br><br><br>
<h3>What is Dragon Quest?</h3>
Dragon Quest is a walking event with a difference - not only do teams compete on their navigation and timekeeping abilities, but they also compete in numerous
small skill-based challenges at various points along the route. Points are awarded for teamwork, walking skills, and challenge performance. The winning team not
only gets the glory of winning, but also our beautiful Dragon trophy for the year.

This year, Dragon Quest is on the 29th of September 2024. Each team will be given a start time between 8:00 and 9:00 after they register. We aim to finish
