<span style = "font-size: 50px; text-align: center; display: block;"><b>1st New Longton's walking event is back for 2025!</b></span>
<br><br><br>
<h3>What is Dragon Quest?</h3>
<p>Dragon Quest is a walking event with a difference - not only do teams compete on their navigation and timekeeping abilities, but they also compete in numerous
small skill-based challenges at various points along the route. Points are awarded for teamwork, walking skills, and challenge performance. The winning team not
only gets the glory of winning, but also our beautiful Dragon trophy for the year.</p>
<br>
<h3>When is Dragon Quest?</h3>
<p>This year, Dragon Quest is on Saturday the 27th of September. Each team will be given a start time between 08:00 and 09:00 after they register. You will need to arrive before your
start time, as your team will need to be checked in and have their kit checked before they set off. We aim to finish between 15:30 and 16:00.</p>
