<p>On Thursday 04th May, we&#39;ll be opening Squirrels in New Longton. We will be meeting at New Longton Methodist Church from 17:00 to 18:00. 
This section is for boys and girls aged 4-6 years old who live in the New Longton area. Initially we have 12 places to offer to young people. Initially to ensure we serve the community we are based in, we&#39;ll be only be accepting young people who live within 1.5km of New Longton All Saints Church or attend New Longton Primary School. 
Our numbers are currently limited due to lack of volunteers, but we hope to be able to offer more young people the chance to join Squirrels in the future!</p>
