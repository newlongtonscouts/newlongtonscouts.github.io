**For Parents and Guardians**



We know that family schedules can change, and we do our best to be flexible while also planning for a safe and fun experience for all Scouts. Here's what you need to know if you need to cancel your child’s event registration:

## Cancelling Your Child’s Event Spot

- **More than 14 days before the event starts** - You’ll get a full refund, minus a small 10% fee to cover admin costs.
- **7 to 14 days before the event** - We can refund 50% of the event fee.
- **Less than 7 days before the event** - Unfortunately, we can’t offer a refund this close to the event, as supplies and activities will already be arranged.
- **If your child doesn't attend the event (no-show)** - No refund will be given.

## Exceptions for Emergencies

We understand that emergencies happen. If your child can't attend the event due to illness, a family emergency, or another serious reason, please contact us as soon as possible. We will review each situation individually.

## If the Event is Cancelled by Us

If we ever need to cancel event (for weather, safety, or other reasons), you’ll get a full refund — or you can choose to move your registration to a different session.

## Financial Hardship

Please contact your leadership team before cancelling your child’s place for this reason – there are plenty of options for the group to help with this. 

## How to Cancel or Make Changes

Please contact the relavent leaders with:
- Your name, contact info and your child’s full name.
- The session they were registered for.
- The reason for the change or cancellation.

## Final Decisions

All refund, transfer, or exception requests are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Group Lead Volunteer, who may approve exceptions or override standard policy when appropriate.
